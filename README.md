# robots-navigate

**1. Introduction**

This project is focus on classofication problem by using machine learning skills

Robots are smart… by design. To fully understand and properly navigate a task, however, they need input about their environment.

We’ll help robots recognize the floor surface they’re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors).

We’ve collected IMU sensor data while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on the university premises. 
The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity. 

**2. Enviorment and Packages**

This project use following packages:

*  sklearn
*  numpy
*  pandas
*  seaborn
*  keras 
*  lgb

**3. Significance**

Using sensors data combine some metdata like mean, median to predict which category. Also ckeck the feature importence for each CV result.

For more results, please see Report.md and Output file.
